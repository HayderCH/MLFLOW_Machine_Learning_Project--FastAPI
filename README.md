# Parkinson's Disease Prediction ‚Äî MLOps Project

**Academic year:** 2024-2025  
**Student:** HayderCH  
**Project:** MLOps Excellence ‚Äî End-to-End ML System with Monitoring

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a full MLOps workflow for Parkinson's Disease prediction, starting from modularized ML code to automated CI/CD, experiment tracking, REST API deployment, containerization, and advanced monitoring with Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch & Kibana).

- **Model:** XGBoost-based classifier predicting Parkinson's Disease from biomedical features.
- **API:** FastAPI serving predictions and storing history.
- **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow with model registry and custom backend.
- **CI/CD:** Makefile, GitHub Actions, linters, auto-formatting, and test automation.
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time prediction logs and metrics in Kibana.

## üí° Features for Excellence

### 1. **Modularized & Clean Code**
- Clear separation between data, modeling, API, and utility logic.
- No circular dependencies; each file serves a single responsibility.

### 2. **Automated CI/CD**
- **Makefile** for local automation (linting, formatting, testing).
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated pipeline for code quality, formatting, and unit testing.
- Linters: Pylint, Flake8, MyPy.
- Code formatter: Black.
- Easily extensible to Jenkins, SonarQube, or email notifications.

### 3. **MLflow Integration**
- Tracks experiments, hyperparameters, and metrics.
- Custom SQLite backend for portability.
- **Model Registry:** Automatic registration and promotion to production stage.
- Model versioning and artifacts tracked.

### 4. **REST API with FastAPI**
- `/predict` endpoint: Get predictions from the latest model.
- `/history` endpoint: View recent prediction history (persisted in SQLite).
- **Well-documented:** OpenAPI/Swagger UI at `/docs`.
- Ready for extension: add `/retrain` endpoint or alternative frameworks (Flask, Django).

### 5. **Docker & Docker Compose**
- One container for FastAPI, another for Elasticsearch, another for Kibana.
- SQLite used for fast local prototyping; easily swapped for PostgreSQL.
- Multi-container orchestration for production-like workflow.

### 6. **Real-Time Monitoring & Logging**
- Every prediction is logged to **Elasticsearch** (features, result, latency, timestamp).
- **Kibana dashboard:** Visualize predictions, latency, and API usage in real time.
- Ready for further monitoring (system metrics, error rates, etc.).

## üèóÔ∏è How to Run

### 1. **Clone the repo & set up environment**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/HayderCH/MLFLOW_Machine_Learning_Project--FastAPI.git
cd MLFLOW_Machine_Learning_Project--FastAPI
```

### 2. **Build and Start All Services**
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
- This will launch:
  - FastAPI app at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
  - Elasticsearch at [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)
  - Kibana dashboard at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

### 3. **Test the API**
- Visit [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for interactive documentation.
- Example prediction:
  ```json
  POST /predict
  {
    "features": [197.9, 0.00755, 0.00007, 0.00370, 0.02087, 0.00017, 0.00577, 0.00981, 0.01650, 0.01747, 0.02448, 0.00220, 0.00322, 0.00566, 0.00681, 0.00867, 0.00908, 0.01660, 0.00023, 0.00088, 0.00000, 0.00000]
  }
  ```

### 4. **Monitor Predictions in Kibana**
- Go to [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
- Create an index pattern with `parkinsons_predictions*`
- Explore predictions, latency, and history.
