1. Modularization (Excellence)
Ensure total independence between modules (no unnecessary cross-imports).
Check for accidental circular imports or “god” modules.
2. CI/CD Automation
Required:

Makefile is present, but no GitHub Actions or other CI/CD workflows detected (.github/workflows not found).
No SonarQube or MyPy targets in Makefile (optional but recommended for excellence). Excellence:
Multi-pipeline (data, training, API, etc.) in CI (not detected).
Notifications on pipeline completion (system/email).
Unit/functional tests—add more tests (only one found).
CI/CD with GitHub Actions (add at least one workflow).
3. MLflow Integration
Required:

Tracking and logging in train.py is present. Excellence:
Model Registry: Ensure you use MLflow’s model registry for versioning.
Custom MLflow backend (e.g., not the default local file store).
Log training curves or additional artifacts.
Automate MLflow with Docker (e.g., a docker-compose for MLflow server).
4. FastAPI Deployment
Required:

FastAPI app expected (not detected in results due to search timeout, verify app.py exists).
OpenAPI/Swagger doc: FastAPI does this by default if you use @app.post etc. Excellence:
Expose a /retrain endpoint (not just /predict).
Try alternative frameworks (Flask, Django) in a branch.
Try plugin or WebSocket endpoints.
5. Dockerization
Required:

Dockerfile present; you have built and published an image. Excellence:
Multi-container setup (docker-compose) for FastAPI + DB.
Store prediction history in a database (not seen).
Try Swarm/Minikube (optional, for bonus).
6. Monitoring
Required:

MLflow metrics logged.
Elasticsearch/Kibana integration not detected. Excellence:
Monitor system (CPU, RAM, disk), containers, etc.
Advanced dashboards (Kibana, Grafana, etc.).
